Embed QuickTime helps you embed QuickTime movies to play directly in your posts.

== Description ==

Embed QuickTime helps you embed QuickTime movies to play directly in your posts, instead of redirecting your video to a separate page or forcing you to embed a video using Flash. It changes regular image links to the embedded QuickTime video when they are clicked. It works with .mov, .mp4, .m4v, .3gp files as well as common audio files (.mp3, .wav and others) There is experimental support for Windows Media files (.avi, .wmv and more).

It has these features:

* Inserts the jQuery files and the required javascript code on pages automatically.
* Inserts a code generator on the Write page. The code generator makes code you can copy and paste into the editor's "Code" view.
* Optionally inserts a 'share' links giving your visitors Copy and Paste code for posting the video on their own sites.
