<h1>netChimes</h1>
<h2>a globally distributed wind instrument</h2>
</div>

<div id = "intro">
<p>netChimes is a wind-actuated instrument comprised of a collection of 20 globally-distributed wind chime sensors. These sensors are connected via the Internet to a collection of physical chimes (a carillon of sorts) located at a public venue. When a remote sensor is triggered by the wind, a corresponding chime is struck at the installation site. As conceived, the installation sonifies and visualizes ambient wind activity, rendering those intangible things &#151 the Internet, the global village, the wind &#151 tangible.</p>

<img src="assets/images/sensor1.JPG" alt = "A netChimes sensor.">

<p>The first stage of this project, to build and distribute 20 netChimes sensors around the planet, is currently underway.  With the generous support of a Part-time Faculty Development Grant from Columbia College Chicago, the array will be deployed by the end of Summer 2015.</p>

<img src="assets/images/sensor2.JPG" alt = "A netChimes sensor's interior.">

<p>Each sensor contains a custom printed circuit board that holds a ring of six magnetic (Hall) switches.  A small magnet in the base of the sail trips the switches, registering a chime strike as the sail is stirred by the wind.</p>

<p style = "text-align: left">The haiku printed on each circuit board reads:</p>
<blockquote style = "text-align: center"><em>
set my sensor to<br>
catch digital butterflies<br>
a tsunami rings<br></em>
</blockquote>

<p>The reverse of the sensor houses a microprocessor to read the magnetic switches and a Wi-Fi radio to communicate with the network.  The entire unit is water/weather resistant.</p>

<p>Currently there is the a single Chicago-based sensor relaying real-time ambient wind activity to the netChimes server and array. The visualization/sonification below displays live netChimes data streams. As more sensors are added globally, this page will be updated.</p>
